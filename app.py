    "Step 0: OCR Extraction": (
        "You are an advanced multi-modal OCR engine. Process the provided raw document image page. "
        "Extract all visible text with 100% literal accuracy, preserving specialized characters, "
        "mathematical equations, and numeric structures. "
        "For every block, line, or explicit word, calculate and output its normalized bounding box "
        "coordinates (Xmin, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax) scaled from 0 to 1000. "
        "If text is distorted, vertically aligned, or displays broken encodings, reconstruct the "
        "correct characters contextually. "
        "Output format: Strict raw JSON stream containing an array of tokens with text and "
        "bounding_box parameters. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks."
    ),
    "Step 1: Layout Analysis": (
        "Analyze the provided PDF page image alongside the raw OCR coordinates from Step 0. "
        "Identify and map the physical layout zones. Classify each zone into one of these types: "
        "Header, Footer, Paragraph, Heading (1-6), List, Table, Image, Sidebar, Separator, or Decorative. "
        "\n\n"
        "SEPARATOR ZONE DEFINITION: "
        "A Separator is any purely visual element used to divide content sections with no readable text. "
        "This includes: horizontal rules, decorative lines, thick borders between sections, "
        "repeated dash or underscore sequences used as dividers, blank whitespace blocks inserted "
        "purely for visual spacing, and ornamental glyphs (e.g. three dots, asterisks, tildes) "
        "used as section breaks. "
        "Do NOT classify a zone as Separator if it contains meaningful text, a heading, or a caption. "
        "A Separator must be flagged with artifact=true in the output zone blueprint. "
        "\n\n"
        "CRITICAL FOR READING ORDER: If a page has two columns, ensure the zones are ordered down "
        "the first column completely before starting the second column. Do not read horizontally "
        "across columns. "
        "Output a structured JSON blueprint mapping zone IDs to their type, sequential reading "
        "position indices, and an artifact boolean flag."
    ),
    "Step 2: Unicode Repair": (
        "Using the layout blueprint from Step 1, map the raw text fragments into their assigned "
        "structural zone IDs. "
        "Verify that sentences breaking across columns or lines are stitched together natively "
        "without artificial hyphenations or line breaks. "
        "Repair all corrupted unicode artifacts so text strings are fully searchable and readable "
        "by text-to-speech software. "
        "Output format: JSON mapping zone IDs to clean, compiled string text."
    ),
    "Step 3: Tag Tree Assembly": (
        "Act as a certified PDF/UA compliance engineer. Take the ordered zone text from Step 2. "
        "Review the global heading history context: {global_context}. "
        "Generate a valid PDF Tag Tree structure applying semantic tags: <H1> through <H6>, "
        "<P>, <L>, <LI>, and <Link>. "
        "CRITICAL: Do not skip heading levels. "
        "\n\n"
        "ARTIFACT TAGGING RULES — apply to every zone marked artifact=true in the layout blueprint: "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE A — SEPARATORS: "
        "Any zone classified as Separator (horizontal rule, decorative line, dash sequence, "
        "ornamental glyph, or pure whitespace block) must be tagged as: "
        "  <Artifact Type=Layout Subtype=Separator> "
        "This instructs all conforming screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack) to skip "
        "the element entirely and move directly to the next real content node. "
        "Do NOT tag separators as <P>, <Div>, or any content tag — doing so causes screen readers "
        "to announce 'blank' or pause on meaningless content. "
        "Do NOT tag separators as <Sect> — that tag implies a structural section with a heading. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE B — RUNNING HEADERS AND FOOTERS: "
        "Any repeated page header or footer zone must be tagged as: "
        "  <Artifact Type=Pagination> "
        "This is distinct from Separator — it marks content that repeats across pages. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE C — DECORATIVE IMAGES AND BACKGROUNDS: "
        "Any zone classified as Decorative (logo watermark, background pattern, "
        "purely ornamental image) must be tagged as: "
        "  <Artifact Type=Layout> "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE D — SECTION BOUNDARIES (correct usage): "
        "If a separator is immediately followed by a new heading, the structural section boundary "
        "is already communicated by the heading tag itself. "
        "Do not insert a <Sect> tag for the separator — the heading provides the hierarchy. "
        "Only use <Sect> as a container grouping a heading and its subordinate content when "
        "the document structure explicitly requires it. "
    ),
    "Step 3.5: Metadata & Bookmarks": (
        "You are a PDF metadata and navigation engineer. Using the completed Tag Tree from Step 3 "
        "and the full document text from Step 2, perform two tasks. "
        "IMPORTANT: Every metadata field is required. Never output null or an empty string for "
        "any field — always derive the best possible value from the document content. "
        "\n\n"
        "TASK A — DOCUMENT METADATA: "
        "Output a 'metadata' JSON object with ALL of the following fields: "
        "\n"
        "title: The document's main title. Look for the largest or most prominent text on the "
        "first page, the first H1 heading, or any text styled as a cover title. "
        "If none is clearly a title, synthesise a descriptive title from the subject matter. "
        "Never leave blank. "
        "\n"
        "author: The name(s) of the author(s) or organisation. Look for bylines, 'Prepared by', "
        "'Written by', 'Author:', or footer/header attribution text. "
        "If not found in the document, output 'Unknown Author'. "
        "\n"
        "subject: A single sentence (max 200 characters) describing what the document covers. "
        "Derive from the introduction, abstract, or opening paragraph. "
        "\n"
        "keywords: 5 to 10 comma-separated terms that best represent the document's topics. "
        "Extract from headings, repeated terms, and key concepts in the body text. "
        "\n"
        "language: ISO 639-1 two-letter language code of the document's primary language "
        "(e.g. 'en' for English, 'fr' for French). "
        "\n"
        "creation_date: The document's original creation date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). "
        "Look for a date on the cover page, in the header/footer, or in any 'Date:' or 'Published:' "
        "field. If no date is found, output today's date. "
        "\n\n"
        "TASK B — BOOKMARK OUTLINE: "
        "Build a hierarchical bookmark outline from every heading tagged H1–H6 in the Tag Tree. "
        "Each entry must include: title (the heading text), level (1–6), page_number (1-based). "
        "Nest child bookmarks under their parent heading. "
        "Output format: JSON object with keys 'metadata' (object) and 'bookmarks' (array of "
        "{ title, level, page_number, children[] } objects)."
    ),
    "Step 4: Image Alt-Text": (
        "Analyze all image and figure assets on this page. "
        "In PDF/UA, images are represented as <Figure> tags in the tag tree. "
        "Apply the following rules to every <Figure> node and every image zone: "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 1 — EMPTY <Figure> REMOVAL: "
        "A <Figure> tag is considered empty if it has no visual content — it renders as a "
        "zero-dimension box, a 1×1 pixel placeholder, an invisible element, or a pure whitespace block. "
        "An empty <Figure> must be removed entirely from the tag tree. "
        "Do not mark it as Artifact — simply delete the node. "
        "An empty <Figure> that is kept causes screen readers to announce 'graphic' with no label, "
        "which is a PDF/UA violation. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 2 — NON-EMPTY <Figure> ALT-TEXT: "
        "Every non-empty <Figure> must have an Alt attribute (alt_text) that is: "
        "  a) Non-empty and non-generic. Never output 'image', 'photo', 'figure', 'graphic', "
        "     'chart', 'picture', or any single word that merely names the element type. "
        "  b) Derived from SURROUNDING TEXT CONTEXT first — read the paragraph, caption, heading, "
        "     or list item immediately before and after the <Figure> in the tag tree. "
        "     This context is the primary signal for what the figure represents. "
        "  c) Combined with visual analysis — describe what is visually shown, why it is relevant "
        "     to the surrounding content, and (for charts/graphs/diagrams) what the key data trend, "
        "     conclusion, or relationship is. "
        "  d) Concise when a caption directly below already describes the image — do not duplicate "
        "     the caption verbatim; instead summarise the visual aspect the caption does not cover. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 3 — DECORATIVE <Figure> AS ARTIFACT: "
        "If the <Figure> contains a spacer, horizontal rule, logo watermark, background texture, "
        "or any purely decorative element with no informational value, do NOT assign alt-text. "
        "Tag it as <Artifact Type=Layout> and set Artifact=True, alt_text=null. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 4 — OUTPUT FORMAT: "
        "For each <Figure> node: set alt_text (string or null) and Artifact (boolean). "
        "Remove empty <Figure> nodes entirely. "
        "Append the updated properties into the existing Tag Tree JSON."
    ),
    "Step 5: Table Parsing": (
        "You are a PDF/UA table accessibility specialist. Isolate every element tagged as a Table "
        "and apply the following rules exhaustively. Examine the historical context: {global_context}. "
        "Check if this table is a continuation of a table from a previous page — if yes, preserve "
        "the same column header configurations from the prior page. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 1 — HEADER CELLS (<TH>): "
        "Every cell that acts as a column or row header must be tagged <TH>. "
        "Each <TH> must carry a scope attribute: "
        "  scope=col  for a cell that heads an entire column, "
        "  scope=row  for a cell that heads an entire row, "
        "  scope=colgroup  for a merged cell spanning multiple columns as a group header, "
        "  scope=rowgroup  for a merged cell spanning multiple rows as a group header. "
        "Never assign scope=col to a row header or vice versa. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 2 — DATA CELLS (<TD>): "
        "Every non-header cell must be tagged <TD>. "
        "Each <TD> must carry a headers attribute listing the IDs of ALL <TH> cells "
        "that apply to it — both the column header ID and the row header ID if both exist. "
        "Assign a unique id attribute to every <TH> cell so that <TD> headers attributes "
        "can reference them (e.g. id=col_2, id=row_3). "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 3 — EMPTY CELLS: "
        "A visually empty or blank cell must NOT be omitted from the tag tree. "
        "Tag it as <TD> (or <TH> if it occupies a header position). "
        "Set its text content to an empty string. "
        "It must still carry the correct headers attribute pointing to its parent header IDs. "
        "A missing cell breaks column alignment for assistive technology — never drop empty cells. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 4 — MERGED CELLS (colspan and rowspan): "
        "A cell spanning multiple columns must have colspan=N where N is the column count. "
        "A cell spanning multiple rows must have rowspan=N where N is the row count. "
        "A merged header cell gets both the appropriate scope and colspan or rowspan. "
        "Every cell underneath a merged header must reference that merged header id "
        "in its headers attribute alongside any row header id. "
        "Account for every grid position — never leave ghost slots where merged cells extend. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 5 — SPLIT HEADERS (multi-level stacked headers): "
        "When a table has two or more header rows (category header above column sub-headers), "
        "tag each level as a separate <TH> row. "
        "Assign unique IDs to every header cell at every level. "
        "Each data cell headers attribute must list ALL header IDs in its column chain "
        "from the top level down to the immediate header. "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 6 — COMPLEX TABLE SUMMARY: "
        "If the table has more than one header row, merged cells, or both row and column headers, "
        "add a Summary attribute to the <Table> tag with a one-sentence plain-language description "
        "of the table structure (e.g. Sales data by region and quarter with merged regional headers). "
        "\n\n"
        "RULE 7 — TABLE CAPTION: "
        "If a visible caption or title exists immediately above or below the table, tag it as "
        "<Caption> and nest it as the first child of the <Table> node. "
        "\n\n"
        "Merge the fully annotated table structure into the master Tag Tree. "
        "Output the complete updated Tag Tree JSON."
    ),
    "Step 6: Contact Link Detection": (
        "Scan the entire Tag Tree for any text that matches a contact detail pattern. "
        "Apply the following rules for each match found: "
        "\n\n"
        "EMAIL ADDRESSES — any text matching the pattern user@domain.tld: "
        "Wrap in a <Link> tag with href='mailto:user@domain.tld'. "
        "Set the link's ActualText to the email address string. "
        "\n\n"
        "PHONE NUMBERS — any numeric pattern resembling a phone number "
        "(e.g. +1 800 555 0100, (020) 7946 0958, 04XX XXX XXX): "
        "Normalise to E.164 format where possible and wrap in <Link> with href='tel:+XXXXXXXXXXX'. "
        "\n\n"
        "HYPERLINKS — any text that is a bare URL (http://, https://, www.) or descriptive "
        "anchor text with a visible URL nearby: "
        "Wrap in <Link> with href equal to the full URL. "
        "If the anchor text is a full URL, set ActualText to the URL. "
        "If the anchor text is descriptive (e.g. 'Visit our website'), keep the descriptive text "
        "as the link label and set href to the associated URL. "
        "\n\n"
        "Do not create links for numbers that are not phone numbers (e.g. page numbers, "
        "product codes, dates). "
        "\n\n"
        "LINK QUALITY RULES (apply to every <Link> node, new or existing): "
        "Every <Link> must have: "
        "  1. A non-empty href attribute (mailto:, tel:, or https:// URL). "
        "  2. A non-empty ActualText attribute containing the human-readable label for the link. "
        "     If a <Link> wraps a <Span> or <P> with empty or whitespace-only text, "
        "     set ActualText to the href value itself (e.g. the email address or URL). "
        "  3. A descriptive label — never 'click here', 'here', 'link', or the bare URL as the "
        "     only visible text when a descriptive label is available nearby. "
        "Remove any <Link> node where both href and ActualText are empty or missing. "
        "Return the updated Tag Tree JSON."
    ),
    "Step 7: Compliance QA": (
        "Act as an automated accessibility auditor. Run a final compliance pass over the completed "
        "Tag Tree against WCAG 2.2 and PDF/UA specifications. Perform all checks and corrections "
        "in the numbered sequence below. "
        "\n\n"
        "1. SEPARATOR ARTIFACT AUDIT: "
        "Scan the entire tag tree for any node originating from a Separator zone "
        "(horizontal rule, decorative line, dash sequence, whitespace block, ornamental glyph). "
        "  a) Tagged as <Artifact Type=Layout Subtype=Separator> — correct, leave it. "
        "  b) Tagged as <P>, <Div>, or <Span> with empty/whitespace text — re-tag as "
        "     <Artifact Type=Layout Subtype=Separator>. "
        "  c) Tagged as <Sect> — remove the <Sect> wrapper, re-tag separator as Artifact, "
        "     and promote any heading/content children to the correct tree level. "
        "  d) Confirm no separator node is reachable by a screen reader's linear navigation. "
        "Report separators_retagged count. "
        "\n\n"
        "2. EMPTY TAG REMOVAL: Find every non-table tag node where text content is null, "
        "empty string, or whitespace-only AND it has no children. Remove these nodes. "
        "NEVER remove <TD> or <TH> nodes — empty table cells must be kept to preserve grid structure. "
        "NEVER remove <Link> nodes solely because their visible text is empty — handle those in check 6. "
        "<Figure> RULE: A <Figure> node is empty if it has no visual content (zero-dimension, "
        "1×1 pixel placeholder, or invisible element). Empty <Figure> nodes must be REMOVED entirely — "
        "not marked as Artifact, not flagged — deleted from the tree. "
        "A kept empty <Figure> causes screen readers to announce 'graphic' with no description. "
        "Count removed <Figure> nodes in empty_tags_removed. "
        "Report empty_tags_removed count. "
        "\n\n"
        "3. TABLE CELL INTEGRITY AUDIT: For every <Table> node verify: "
        "  a) Every <TH> has scope=col/row/colgroup/rowgroup. Fix by inferring from position. "
        "  b) Every <TH> has a unique id (format: th_tN_rM_cK). Fix by assigning from position. "
        "  c) Every <TD> has headers attribute referencing all applicable <TH> ids. Fix by inference. "
        "  d) Grid is complete — expected cell count = rows × columns adjusted for spans. "
        "     Insert <TD> with empty text and correct headers for any missing slot. "
        "  e) Merged cells declare colspan=N and/or rowspan=N. Fix by inferring from visual span. "
        "  f) Complex tables have Summary attribute on <Table>. Generate plain-language summary if missing. "
        "Report cells_fixed count. "
        "\n\n"
        "4. ALT-TEXT AUDIT: "
        "  a) Every non-Artifact <Figure> node must have a non-empty Alt attribute (alt_text). "
        "     If alt_text is missing, empty, or a generic word ('image', 'photo', 'figure', "
        "     'graphic', 'chart', 'picture'), it counts as missing. "
        "     Flag as alt_text_missing=True and report the count. "
        "     Do NOT attempt to generate alt-text in this QA step — that is Stage 4's responsibility. "
        "     Only flag so the issue is visible in the qa_summary. "
        "  b) Every non-Artifact image node that is not a <Figure> must also have alt_text. "
        "     Apply the same check and flag. "
        "Report alt_text_missing count. "
        "\n\n"
        "5. TABLE HEADER AUDIT: Every <Table> must have at least one <TH> with scope. "
        "Flag tables missing this as table_header_missing=True. "
        "Report table_headers_missing count. "
        "\n\n"
        "6. LINK INTEGRITY AND QUALITY: For every <Link> node: "
        "  a) Must have a non-empty href (mailto:, tel:, or URL). Remove if href is empty/missing. "
        "  b) Must have non-empty ActualText. If ActualText is empty or missing, "
        "     set it to the href value (e.g. the email address or URL string). "
        "  c) If the link wraps only a <Span> or child with empty/whitespace text and no ActualText, "
        "     set ActualText to the href value. "
        "  d) ActualText must never be 'click here', 'here', 'link', or a bare URL when a "
        "     descriptive label is available in surrounding content — fix if found. "
        "Report links_removed count (links deleted) and links_repaired count (ActualText fixed). "
        "\n\n"
        "7. HEADING SEQUENCE AUDIT: Walk H1–H6 across the document. "
        "Insert synthetic heading with text '[Section continued]' at any skipped level. "
        "Report heading_gaps_corrected count. "
        "\n\n"
        "Output the corrected, finalized, compliant JSON tag tree. Include a 'qa_summary' key "
        "with counts: separators_retagged, empty_tags_removed, cells_fixed, alt_text_missing, "
